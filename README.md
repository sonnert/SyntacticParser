Syntactic parser using part-of-speech tagging, multi-class perceptron classifier, and transition-based dependency parsing which uses the arc-standard algorithm.


Training and evaluating the baseline system on Universal Dependency (UD) treebanks on English and Swedish yields a tagging score of 87.41% and 88.34%, and a parsing score of 58.79% and 53.42%, respectively.


Although the program allows for the option of using beam search, it is not very useful as the training is performed on individual moves.
